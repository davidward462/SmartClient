SmartClient

SmartClient.py accepts exactly one argument, which is the address of the host to connect to. Adding a file path is optional.

For connecting to www.example.com, use the following command:

python3 SmartClient.py www.example.com

For connecting to www.example.com/path/index.html, use the following command:

python3 SmartClient.py www.example.com/path/index.html

SmartClient.py may not work correctly if run using a Python version less than python3.
